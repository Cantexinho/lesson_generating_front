    summary:
      "DeepSeek quietly dropped a powerful V3 model, and all eyes are now on what comes next: R2 and a potential clash with America’s top contenders.",
    content:
      "China’s DeepSeek just shadow-dropped a new version of V3 — the base model that came out before R1 — that weighs in at just 641 GB, meaning it could theoretically run on a high-end Mac.\n\nIt seems to be especially good at math and coding, and AI researcher Xeophon even called it the “best non-reasoning model, dethroning [Anthropic’s] Sonnet 3.5.” Plus, it was released with an MIT license, meaning anyone can tweak and adapt it with very few restrictions.\n\nBut this might just be the appetizer before the main course: V3 served as the base for R1, the reasoning-focused model that shocked the industry earlier this year. If that trend continues, DeepSeek will likely use this new model to train R2. And we probably don’t have too long to wait, with reports suggesting it could be here before May.\n\nBut the US might already have its answer: A mysterious new model called “Nebula” recently jumped to the top of the LMArena leaderboard — and rumor has it that it’s a soon-to-be-released model called Gemini 2.0 Pro Thinking. Google’s own research scientists are winking at the possibility. It looks like we’re headed toward a major showdown between DeepSeek and its well-funded US counterparts.",

    summary:
      "ChatGPT's Ghibli image feature sparked a global trend, especially in India, helping the app top global downloads. Now, a new wave of action figure-style images hints that the next big thing in tech might once again look like a toy.",
    content:
      "Chris Dixon once said, “The next big thing will start out looking like a toy.” That insight from 2010 continues to hold true — especially in the case of ChatGPT’s latest viral wave: Studio Ghibli-style image generation.\n\nIt began innocently enough. People around the world uploaded selfies and watched as ChatGPT transformed them into enchanting, Ghibli-inspired artwork.But behind the whimsical fun was a serious surge in user growth. While social feeds filled with dreamy anime portraits, ChatGPT quietly shattered records. On March 31, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote, “The ChatGPT launch 26 months ago was one of the craziest viral moments I'd ever seen, and we added one million users in five days. We added one million users in the last hour.”\n\nOne of the biggest revelations from this trend? India. The Ghibli-style craze resonated deeply across the subcontinent, catalyzing an explosion in new users.\n\nOpenAI COO Brad Lightcap called India their fastest-growing market for ChatGPT, and Altman even joined the party, posting a Ghibli image of himself playing cricket — an unmistakable nod to Indian users. The result: ChatGPT became the most downloaded app globally in March.\n\nNow, another viral wave is forming. Users are beginning to create action figure-style images of themselves and celebrities, further pushing the boundaries of how we interact with AI and self-expression. Once again, something that looks like a toy is becoming the centerpiece of a tech movement.\n\nThe next big thing? It just might be made of plastic.",
